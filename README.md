# Running Idle


### Background and Overview
 - Running idle is a workout app that gameifies running! 
 - Using Google maps API, we implement a points based system to encourage running by logging runs, and tracking user location
 - Create a custom character and see the progression of your all your hard work through that character!
 - includes real time degradation of characters, and rewards, to encourage consistent workouts! 
 
 - Running Idle is built with the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node).


### Functionality and MVP
 - User Authentication => Users are able to sign up, sign in, and log out.
 - Character Creation (CRUD) => User will create a character that reflects that users real life physical activity, allowing them to alter their character as they like
 - Logging Runs => Users will be able to track their runs base on location, and data will be logged in their account
 - Challenges, Reward, Achievements! => By offering extra activities we will encourage users to go the extra mile to collect them all.
